# Payment Flow Documentation (Ride â†’ Stripe â†’ WebSocket)

This document describes how the payment lifecycle works in the bike rental system after a ride ends. It covers both **successful** and **failed** payments, and explains how the frontend, backend, and Stripe interact.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Actors

- **Ride Service** â†’ Publishes events when rides end.
- **Payment Service** â†’ Handles payment creation, Stripe interaction, webhook processing, and WebSocket notifications.
- **Frontend (Client)** â†’ Displays pages and reacts to WebSocket messages.
- **Stripe** â†’ Processes payments and sends webhooks.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Flow Overview

1. **Ride ends**

   - Ride Service publishes a `RIDE_ENDED` event with `rideId`, `userId`, and `amount`.

2. **Payment Service creates payment**

   - Listens for `RIDE_ENDED`.
   - Creates a Stripe Checkout Session or PaymentIntent with `metadata: { rideId, userId }`.
   - Stores payment in DB with status = `pending`.
   - Sends WebSocket message to frontend:

     ```json
     {
       "type": "PAYMENT_CREATED",
       "rideId": "ride_123",
       "paymentUrl": "https://checkout.stripe.com/session/xyz"
     }
     ```

3. **Frontend redirects user to Stripe Checkout**

   - User enters card details.
   - Payment either **succeeds** or **fails**.

4. **Stripe sends webhook â†’ Payment Service**

   - Stripe sends `checkout.session.completed` on success.
   - Stripe sends `payment_intent.payment_failed` or `checkout.session.expired` on failure.

5. **Payment Service updates DB**

   - On success â†’ mark as `succeeded`.
   - On failure â†’ mark as `failed`, store failure reason.

6. **Payment Service notifies frontend via WebSocket**

   - Success message:

     ```json
     {
       "type": "PAYMENT_STATUS",
       "rideId": "ride_123",
       "status": "succeeded"
     }
     ```

   - Failure message:

     ```json
     {
       "type": "PAYMENT_STATUS",
       "rideId": "ride_123",
       "status": "failed",
       "reason": "Card declined"
     }
     ```

7. **Frontend updates UI accordingly**

   - On success â†’ redirect to `/receipt/:rideId`.
   - On failure â†’ redirect to `/payment-retry/:rideId` and display error.
